# Configuration files
Configuration files for various services.
I try to update as much as possible.
Any suggestions are welcome, by no means i think these are "the best possible".
Always a work on progress, this repo is never done for.

# NGINX: 
Working with php-fpm on fastcgi mode and unix sockets.
Caching enabled, ssl ready.
Wordpress ready and friendly. 
Great perfomance.

# PHP-FPM:
Some security best practices on php.ini
Vhost/Pool example ready, great way to isolate when running multiple sites on 1 server.
Multiple sockets for better perfomance with nginx.
